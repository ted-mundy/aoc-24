# Day 1

First ever challenge. I think there is some sort of theme that both challenges are related/share logic?
This one does, anyway. All in Rust!

**Update**
I've done my best to make the error-handling on this small project quite good. After all, people love Rust's errors (including me), so
why unwrap everything, when it could panic?
Hope to learn more as the days go on :)
