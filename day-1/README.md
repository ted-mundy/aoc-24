# Day 1

First ever challenge. I think there is some sort of theme that both challenges are related/share logic?
This one does, anyway. All in Rust!

**Update**
I've done my best to make the error-handling on this small project quite good. After all, people love Rust's errors (including me), so
why unwrap everything, when it could panic?
Hope to learn more as the days go on :)

**Update 2**
I've posted this on [Reddit](https://old.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1h4e9y3/rust_newbie_here_would_appreciate_code_review/), and the nice people over there have given me a couple tips.
Also reminded me I shouldn't post my inputs. Thanks! Will look to put in some of the improvements over the next
few days.
